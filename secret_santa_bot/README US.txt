Secret Santa Bot Guide

The task is made in the form of a bot in telegram, so without turning it on, nothing will work
If you want to use your own bot, you just need to change the API key for correct work

HOW TO PLAY ?

- You need to start the bot either using the console after going to the desired directory and writing node app.js, or using various IDEs (Web storm, VS Code, etc.)
- you need to write to the bot (@S3cr3tSanta_bot) Check in to register and check out to exit
- in the game can participate from 3 to 500 people. When all your friends have registered, write start game, after which the bot will give you the nickname of the person you are giving a gift to
- write stop game to end the game

IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW
- The bot uses your telegram nickname as an identifier. If you don't have a nickname, the bot will return undefined, and if there are two or more friends without nicknames,
you just get confused about who is who. For the bot to work correctly, it is still necessary that all participants in the game have nicknames
- If you wrote check in two or more times, nothing bad will happen, the bot will work correctly
